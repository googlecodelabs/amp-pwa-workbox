# AMP and PWA

In this codelab, youâ€™ll convert an app containing AMP pages into a PWA using two different patterns:

1. transform an AMP site into a PWA (AMP as PWA)
2. use the App Shell architecture to create a PWA that uses AMP as content (AMP in PWA)

AMP+PWA gives you the best of both worlds: a lightning fast first load with AMP, and native-like capabilities in the PWA.

You'll also get a chance to use [Workbox](https://workboxjs.org/).
